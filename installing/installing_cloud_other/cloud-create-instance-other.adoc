Access {product-title-managed} ({product-title-managed-short}) by selecting an instance in the {cloud-console}. An *ACS instance* contains the {product-title-managed-short} management interface and services that Red Hat configures and manages for you. The management interface connects to your secured clusters, which contain the services that scan and collect information about vulnerabilities. One instance can connect to and monitor multiple clusters.
