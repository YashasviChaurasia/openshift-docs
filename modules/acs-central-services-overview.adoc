= Central services

You install Central services on a single cluster.
These services include two main components, Central and Scanner.

* *Central*: Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple {ocp} or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Scanner*: Scanner is a Red Hat-developed and certified vulnerability scanner for scanning container images. Scanner performs the following functions:

** It analyzes all image layers and checks for known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
** It identifies vulnerabilities in installed packages and dependencies for multiple programming languages.
In addition to scanning container images, Scanner identifies vulnerabilities in the node's operating system and orchestrators.
For example, it scans nodes to identify Kubernetes, {ocp}, and Istio vulnerabilities.
