To monitor a cluster, you must deploy Sensor.
You must deploy Sensor into each cluster that you want to monitor.
The following steps describe adding Sensor by using the RHACS portal.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*.
. Select *+ New Cluster*.
. Specify a name for the cluster.
. Provide appropriate values for the fields based on where you are deploying the Sensor.
ifndef::cloud-svc[]
** If you are deploying Sensor in the same cluster, accept the default values for all the fields.
** If you are deploying into a different cluster, replace `central.stackrox.svc:443` with a load balancer, node port, or other address, including the port number, that is accessible from the other cluster.
** If you are using a non-gRPC capable load balancer, such as HAProxy, AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), or AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), use the WebSocket Secure (`wss`) protocol. To use `wss`:
*** Prefix the address with *`wss://`*.
*** Add the port number after the address, for example, `wss://stackrox-central.example.com:443`.
endif::[]
ifdef::cloud-svc[]
** Enter the Central API Endpoint, including the address and the port number. You can view this information again in the {cloud-console} by choosing *Advanced Cluster Security* -> *ACS Instances*, and then clicking the ACS instance you created.
endif::[]
. Click *Next* to continue with the Sensor setup.
. Click *Download YAML File and Keys* to download the cluster bundle (zip archive).
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The cluster bundle zip archive includes unique configurations and keys for each cluster.
Do not reuse the same files in another cluster.
====
. From a system that has access to the monitored cluster, unzip and run the `sensor` script from the cluster bundle:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ unzip -d sensor sensor-<cluster_name>.zip
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./sensor/sensor.sh
----
If you get a warning that you do not have the required permissions to deploy Sensor, follow the on-screen instructions, or contact your cluster administrator for assistance.

After Sensor is deployed, it contacts Central and provides cluster information.

.Verification
. Return to the {product-title-short} portal and check if the deployment is successful.
If successful, when viewing your list of clusters in *Platform Configuration* -> *Clusters*, the cluster status displays a green checkmark and a *Healthy* status. 
If you do not see a green checkmark, use the following command to check for problems:
ifndef::kube[]
* On {ocp}:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get pod -n stackrox -w
----
endif::[]
* On Kubernetes:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ kubectl get pod -n stackrox -w
----
. Click *Finish* to close the window.

After installation, Sensor starts reporting security information to {product-title-short} and the {product-title-short} portal dashboard begins showing deployments, images, and policy violations from the cluster on which you have installed the Sensor.
