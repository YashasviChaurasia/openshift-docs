Most errors occur during Collector startup when Collector configures itself and finds or downloads a kernel driver for the system.

The following diagram describes the main parts
of Collector startup process:

.Collector pod startup process

If any part of the startup procedure fails, the logs display a diagnostic summary detailing which steps succeeded or failed . 

The following log file example shows a successful startup:  

[source,terminal]
----
[INFO    2022/11/28 13:21:55] == Collector Startup Diagnostics: ==
[INFO    2022/11/28 13:21:55]  Connected to Sensor?       true
[INFO    2022/11/28 13:21:55]  Kernel driver available?   true
[INFO    2022/11/28 13:21:55]  Driver loaded into kernel? true
[INFO    2022/11/28 13:21:55] ====================================
----

The log output confirms that Collector connected to Sensor and located and loaded the kernel driver. 
You can use this log to check for the successful startup of Collector.
